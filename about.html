     This webpage is going to be a great testament to my work and work ethic. I will aim to become a great coder and hopefully minor in Cybersecurity.
        <br>
        The page can be considered to be going through maintenance as the next few weeks, we will see great upgrades to the site and its capabilities.

        I am currently aiming to get my triple major in History, Economics, and Political science. Along the way, I wish to inspire friends and classmates alike!
